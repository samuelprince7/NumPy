# NumPy
This repository demonstrates the core concepts &amp; workings w/NumPy. NumPy is foundational to the Python Data Science ecosystem, upon which so much else is built. In other words, "IF I have been able to see farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants", in this case NumPy since it's creation in 1995


Mean Normalization & Data Separation with NumPy
● coded in NumPy to preform mean normalization on a data set, so that all values became distributed evenly around zero, guaranteeing the average of all elements is close to zero. 
● preformed Data Separation on the data using NumPy's np.random.permutation(). 
● created 3 datasets (Training 60%, Validation 20%, Test 20%) so that machine learning operations can be preformed.
